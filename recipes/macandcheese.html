        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <Ul>
            <li>8 ounces elbow macaroni, or other short pasta (shells or fusilli)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>10 ounces evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Italian Cheddar (such as Sartore MontAmoré® Cheddar), divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Gruyère cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons fontina, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sharp Cheddar, divided</li>
            <li>2 (0.9 ounce) pieces Brie cheese, rind removed tablespoons milk</li>
        </Ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour until mixture is a smooth paste and no lumps remain. Slowly pour in evaporated milk, whisking continuously. Whisk in Worcestershire, Dijon mustard, and salt, and cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the 1/4 cup each MontAmoré® Cheddar, Gruyère, fontina, and sharp Cheddar. Remove rind from Brie. Add Brie to the sauce, and stir until all cheese is melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta and add to the cheese sauce. Pour half of the macaroni and cheese into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Toss remaining 2 tablespoons each of MontAmoré® Cheddar, Gruyère, fontina, and sharp Cheddar together in a small bowl; sprinkle half of cheese mixture over pasta. Pour remaining pasta into the dish; sprinkle remaining cheese mixture over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
